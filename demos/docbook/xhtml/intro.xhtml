<p id="fslogo">Flying Saucer XML/CSS2 Renderer</p>
<span id="pagebyline">DocBook XML Rendering via Pure CSS</span><br/>

<p>This is a rendering of a portion of the <em>jEdit User's Guide</em>, which is written in 
DocBook XML; the User's Guide is released under the Free Documentation License. 
The content shown here is stored in XML and is rendered by Flying Saucer using the DocBook-CSS 
library by David Holroyd et.al. While there is no 'official' CSS for DocBook (e.g. CSS which 
covers the full DocBook specification and which works in major browsers), this should 
give you a taste of the pure XML/CSS rendering capabilities of Flying Saucer. We are not, in 
this case, converting to XHTML first, although that is another option.</p>
