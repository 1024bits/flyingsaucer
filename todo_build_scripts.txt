Notes on TODO items for the Ant build scripts

- add rest of demo apps to distribution
  - update JNLP files using browser_demo.jnlp as a model
  - see if we can generify dist.all to handle multiple demo apps without so much Ant code
- in demo apps, codebase should be replaceable parameter
  - can replace CODEBASE during dist.all
- remove unused targets
  - need to search per target across all .xml files
- clean properties
  - grown too large!
