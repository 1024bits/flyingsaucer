The Flying Saucer Team is proud to present Beta Release 4 (R4) of our 100% Java XHTML + CSS2 Renderer.

This release brings updates to the infrastructure with

    a new package heirarchy
    a new unified CSS module
    automated unit tests to validate our rendering compliance
    new configuration and logging subsystem
    lots more code cleanup
    separate browser and about box sub projects
    
This release paves the way for the new features and speed increases coming
in R5.  Thanks for all of your support and please send us your feedback.

The Flying Saucer XHTMLRenderer can be used anywhere a program needs rich
styled content. This includes ebook readers, chat apps, splash screens,
help viewers, report generation, web-enabled thick clients, and online
music stores.

known bugs
//table cell and table widths don't work with percentages.
ex: 50% => 50px instead of .5 of parent width
fixed.

//bug where a table cell will get sized twice if it has an explict size,
once from the table and once directly from css

bug where it goes into an infinite loop if the available width < 0 or
there is an unbreakable that keeps going down line to line. it should stop after the first one down and then be added even if there isn't room.
