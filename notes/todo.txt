plans for threading

need to move layout to it's own thread

paint on htmlpanel will trigger the layout thread
set document will also trigger the layout thread
if layout thread already running on same document then don't do anything
if layout thread already running on older document, then stop it and start the new one

on paint()
    if layout thread done laying out then render it
    if layout thread not done then print a layout in progress message
initially put this code into the htmlpanel. move it out later

plan:
    startLayout() sync
    layoutDone() sync
    isLayoutDone() sync
    render()

known bugs
//table cell and table widths don't work with percentages.
ex: 50% => 50px instead of .5 of parent width
fixed.

//bug where a table cell will get sized twice if it has an explict size,
once from the table and once directly from css

bug where it goes into an infinite loop if the available width < 0 or
there is an unbreakable that keeps going down line to line. it should stop after the first one down and then be added even if there isn't room.

if browser load crashes it breaks the app

ul li styling

NPE on selectors.xhtml

clipping problems

text not defaulting to times

second inf loop bug

test cm, inches, etc needs DPI setting ?
