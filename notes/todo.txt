known bugs
table cell and table widths don't work with percentages.
ex: 50% => 50px instead of .5 of parent width
fixed.

bug where a table cell will get sized twice if it has an explict size,
once from the table and once directly from css

bug where it goes into an infinite loop if the available width < 0 or
there is an unbreakable that keeps going down line to line. it should stop after the first one down and then be added even if there isn't room.

if browser load crashes it breaks the app

ul li styling

NPE on selectors.xhtml

clipping problems

text not defaulting to times

second inf loop bug

test cm, inches, etc
