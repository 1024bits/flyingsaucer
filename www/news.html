<h1>Flying Saucer Project: News</h1>

<h2 class="fs_heading" style="clear: none;">News</h2>

<p style="font-size: 14pt;">Release 8 &#8211; Release Candidate 1 (R8rc1)</p>

<p><strong>March 8, 2009</strong>: After a long hiatus from releases, we are proud to present release candidate 1 of our R8 releaseThis release includes a large number of bug fixes since R8 pre 2. Given the stability of our current source trunk, this release will most likely be the same as the R8 final. We encourage you to test this release out and give us feedback so that R8 will be our best release ever.</p>

<p>We once again thank the many people who contributed to this release (named in the changes that follow).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Upgrade to use iText 2.0.8</li>
      <li>Support for callback on form submission using new FormSubmissionListener interface; patch from Christophe Marchand (thanks, Christophe!).</li>
      <li>Support reading properties which are not in our standard config file, passed in via an override config file or via System properties. This is to support extended configuration parameters for <span class="caps">JDK</span> logging, e.g. appenders, formatters, etc.</li>
      <li>Added <span class="caps">XML</span>-APIs to lib directory to support compilation when using Java 1.4, which includes it's own (old) version of the <span class="caps">XML</span> APIs. This allows us to reference classes in the newer <span class="caps">XML</span> APIs for which there are Java 1.4 implementations.</li>
      <li>Support adding custom header properties on <span class="caps">PDF</span> output</li>
      <li>Add ability to set <span class="caps">PDF</span> version programmatically</li>
      <li>Add ability to manipulate <span class="caps">PDF</span> output document before it's closed</li>
      <li>Implement -fs-keep-with-inline: keep property that instructs FS to try to avoid breaking a box so that only borders and padding appear on a page</li>
      <li>Expose copy of parsed entities from catalog.</li>
      <li>Add ability to have different starting page number for first document too</li>
      <li>Add <span class="caps">API</span> to retrieve <span class="caps">PDF</span> page and coordinates for boxes with an ID attribute</li>
      <li>Improve support for <span class="caps">PDF</span> encryption, patch from Josh Hayes-Sheen: allow finer control over the encryption of <span class="caps">PDF</span> output; default to standard 128bit but now one can choose between that, 40bit, or AES_128, and can 'or'PdfWriter.DO_NOT_ENCRYPT_METADATA against it</li>
      <li>Support using a Document instance with Java2DRenderer; patch from Michael Janiszewski Browser</li>
      <li>demo app: Add <span class="caps">PDF</span> export to browser (patch from Mykola Gurov)</li>
      <li>Implement <span class="caps">CMYK</span> color support for <span class="caps">PDF</span> output, starting with patch from Mykola Gurov</li>
      <li>Make FSScrollPane a bean; patch from Nicholas Sushkin.</li>
      <li>Add rudimentary support for data URLs (patch from Sean Bright)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes and Tweaks
    <ul>
      <li>Fix <span class="caps">NPE</span> in BlockBoxing reported by Christophe Marchand</li>
      <li>Always treat running elements as blocks</li>
      <li>Skip running blocks when calculating min/max widths</li>
      <li>Fix floats-aren't-exact bug in text measuring</li>
      <li>Avoid creating spurious line boxes when the root box/element is declared inline</li>
      <li>Fix off-by-one error in page location calculation</li>
      <li>Create left space for ol, ul, dir, menu with padding instead of margin per Safari and FF</li>
      <li>Make list marker display more like Safari and FF (patch from Mykola Gurov)</li>
      <li>Need to account for list-marker-position: inside when calculating inline min/max widths (CSS parsing)</li>
      <li>Allow percentages in cymk() function / Skip rule if value is outside the range 0 to 1</li>
      <li>Fix various bugs related to collapsed table borders (one manifestation found by Olly Headey)</li>
      <li>Banish java.awt.Color from FS core layout classes (PDF)</li>
      <li>Expose root box and dotsPerPoint fields</li>
      <li>Fix, was using Font.getName() instead of Font.getFamily() to pick up the value to use in <span class="caps">CSS</span> font-family property.</li>
      <li>Issue 213: support foreground color setting in selection highlight.</li>
      <li>Fix two bugs when -fs-table-paginate is paginate.</li>
      <li>Block boxes in cells in a &lt;thead&gt; that were also early on the page could be positioned incorrectly. Line boxes contained within inline-block or inline-table content in a paginated table were generally placed incorrectly.</li>
      <li>Don't assume namespace processing is turned on. It might not be for an externally provided Document.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="caps">URI</span> class instead of the <span class="caps">URL</span> class when resolving @import rules. This avoids spurious exceptions due to missing protocol handlers when those protocols are handled by a custom user agent.</li>
      <li>Fix a pair of NPEs when absolutely positioned content is positioned off the page</li>
      <li>If no Document instance is available, getDocumentTitle() should return ""; suggestion from Nicholas Sushkin on mailing list.</li>
      <li>Allow root box to be a table box too instead of a plain block box</li>
      <li>Issue #228: when setting document from a file, use file.getAbsoluteFile().getParentFile() to find the parent, in case the file provided has no directory or path; otherwise, file.getParentFile() returns null, and we have no way of determining a base <span class="caps">URI</span>. Covers at least the (reproducible) part of the issue.</li>
      <li>Issue #243: handle case where for some reason, a <span class="caps">JNLP</span> launched app could not read the default configuration file. This was throwing an RE which then cause FS logging to fail. Now load hard-coded properties (ick!) if we can't read the file itself.</li>
      <li>Issue #244: handle case where, because image can't be loaded, an AWTFSImage is created with a null Image element. In this case, we replace it with a single-pixel transparent image.</li>
      <li>Ensure <span class="caps">JDK</span> 1.4 <span class="caps">API</span> compliance.</li>
      <li>If our minimum width is greater than the calculated <span class="caps">CSS</span> width, don't try to allocate any margin space to auto margins.</li>
      <li>Make sure to close file streams (patch from Christophe Marchand).</li>
      <li>Fix for bug #239: find must return null if box is hidden (detective work by Ludovic Durand-Texte)</li>
      <li>Fix for bug #240, #224 and #230: Mouse out events are not properly transferred on anchor boxes;  (patch from Ludovic Durand-Texte)</li>
      <li>Optimize implementation of page-break-inside: avoid</li>
      <li>Issue #226 patch from Christophe Marchand Issue #231: allow for centered page box in preview mode.</li>
      <li>Use getLocalName() instead of getTagName(), in case element is in a namespace&#8212;this works because we configure the parser to be namespace aware, otherwise getLocalName() might return null if not in a namespace. Reported by Erik Bruchez in email.</li>
      <li>Need to update current <span class="caps">BFC</span> offset when adjusting row position due to vertical border spacing / A row group with only empty rows (no cells) won't create a grid. Don't assume we have a grid just because we have rows.</li>
      <li>Continue processing even if a stylesheet can't be found or there is an I/O problem loading it.</li>
      <li>Issues #223,211,212,213,214,215,216: fixes for text selection.</li>
      <li>Issue #225: allow user to specify type for buffered image, instead of just defaulting to transparent image support.</li>
      <li>Upgrade to iText 2.0.8 / Fix iText related deprecation warnings / Implement page level <span class="caps">XMP</span> metadata for <span class="caps">PDF</span> output</li>
      <li>Comment out non-ASCII characters in escapeHTML() for now. Will only work if the compiler assumes the source file encoding is <span class="caps">ISO</span>-8859-1 (or maybe Cp1252). Does not work on Linux (with a default encoding of <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8). Should be replaced with equivalent Unicode escapes.</li>
      <li>On printing, not updating the total page count, required because this is not otherwise available in the rendering context we create for each page</li>
      <li>ITextRenderer: Added setDocumentFromString()</li>
      <li>On calling DocumentListener methods, make sure we catch exceptions from listener implementations which could otherwise kill our work on the <span class="caps">EDT</span>.</li>
      <li>Fix divide by zero error in justification algorithm</li>
      <li>Graphics2DRenderer should use the <span class="caps">UAC</span> available on the panel, and the document should not be set from base <span class="caps">URL</span>, but rather the current panel document, as base <span class="caps">URL</span> may point to a parent directory, not a file (from email from Eddy Zavaleta).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
