<h1>Flying Saucer: a 100% Java XHTML + CSS 2 renderer</h1>
<p><img src="images/flyingsaucer.jpg" float="left"/></p>

<p>Flying Saucer is a 100% Java strictly compliant XHTML + CSS1/2 (3?)
renderer. We are focusing on strict compliance with the complete CSS
standard (the W3C's 2.1 standard initially), mainly for thick clients
like the iTunes Music Store, chat programs, help viewers, splashscreens, and
any other place where html is useful inside an application.</p>

<p>Flying Saucer is not a general purpose webbrowser. This means legacy
/non-compliant pages (ie, the general internet) will be supported through
compatibility libraries rather than modifying the core renderer. We aim to be
the definitive open 100% Java renderer for HTML content.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>v 0.02
<a href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/dist/fs.jnlp">webstart</a> link<br/>
<a href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/files/documents/1821/5847/flyingsaucer.zip">binary</a> distribution<br/>
<a href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/files/documents/1821/5846/flyingsaucer.src.zip">source</a> distribution<br/>

You need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> and the 1.4 JDK to compile the source. Run <i>ant
test</i> to launch the test program. Select different tests from the
<i>Test</i> menu. </p>

<h3>We need help!</h3>

<p><b>If you want to contribute</b> or just see what's going on then please
join the <a
href="https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"><b>dev</b>
mailing list</a>! We need developers, beta testers, doc writers,
evangelists, and users. Even if you are just curious please join in. </p>

<p> This is a *very challenging project* and we need some top flight people
to work on it. In particular we want module owners for the following:

<ul>

<li> Rendering compliance (research the latest standards, build it, test it)</li>
<li> CSS (parsing, converting, optimizing, rendering new features)</li>
<li> HTML-&gt;XHTML converter (support for HTML 3/4.0 pages)</li>
<li> Browser component (a standalone webbrowser based on Flying Saucer)</li>
<li> Javascript support (how do we plug in rhino?)</li>
<li> I18N efforts (how do we make sure the whole thing is i18n-able)</li>
<li> forms (input, select, text area, etc)</li>
<li> object and plugin support (SVG, xforms, flash, pdf)</li>
<li> printing module (we can't print anything yet!)</li>
<li> network module (ssl, redirects, image loading, etc.)</li>
<li> performance and memory optimization (how do we make the whole thing as fast and light as possible)</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h3>Current Status</h3>

<p>The code currently supports a good portion of the CSS 2.0 spec. There
are still parts missing with tables (row spanning and the alternative
layout algorithm), floating (inter context floats don't work properly), and
there's still a bit of wonkiness with absolute vs relative boxes. There is
also no support for forms yet. The main limitation is that it's very very
slow (the line breaking algorithm uses regexs) and does a lot of
unnecessary recalculations. </p>
