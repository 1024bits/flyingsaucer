<h1>The Flying Saucer FAQ </h1>
<h2>What is Flying Saucer?</h2>
<p>Flying Saucer is an XHTML renderer written in Java. It's 100% Java, not a
  native wrapper, and it only handles valid XHTML + CSS. It is intended for
  embedding webbased user interfaces into java applications (ex. the iTunes
  Music Store). It cannot be used as a general purpose webbrowser since it
  does not support the malformed legacy HTML found on the web, though recent
  work on compatibility libraries may be enough to do what you need. See JTidy
  integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Does Flying Saucer support legacy HTML?</h2>
<p>Flying Saucer is not an HTML component. It is a rendering component for XHTML
  content, but it cannot handle the malformed HTML 4.0 of general webpages,
  and it has no support for purely stylistic markup like FONT and CENTER. You
  have to use valid XHTML and CSS. For most embedded uses this is fine since
  the application author usually has control over the documents to be loaded.
  If you really need full IE/Mozilla/Safari like fidelity for general purpose
  webpages you should look into a webbrowser wrapper like JRex or JDIC's Browser
  component.</p>
<h2>What about the JavaDoc browser?</h2>
<p>Okay, you got me. The JavaDoc browser reads the older, non-compliant html
  output of the javadoc program. This was accomplished using the JTidy parser
  and a newly developed compatibility library. Join the mailing list if you want
  more information. </p>
<h2>Is Flying Saucer a web browser?</h2>
<p>  The core renderer just handles XHTML and CSS. It doesn't know anything about
    form submission, managing cookies, or tracking the browsing history. It
    just renders XHTML/CSS to the screen. However, Flying Saucer does include
    a Browser application which provides these features an more. You can use
  this as a good starting point for your own applications.</p>
<h2>What kind of applications
can I use Flying Saucer for?</h2>
<p>Flying Saucer can be used for any Java application
    that requires some sort of styled text. This can be as simple as a chat program
    or as complicated as a complete ebook reader with dynamic stylesheets. Flying
    Saucer is very forward thinking and is designed to be a part of the next
  generation of applications that combine rich desktop clients with web content.
  Some examples of application types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>chat programs</li>
  <li>online music stores</li>
  <li>a gutenberg ebook reader</li>
  <li>a distributed dictionary application</li>
  <li>sherlock style map search and movie
    search</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> components</li>
  <li>an RSS reader</li>
  <li>a local Friendster client</li>
  <li>an eBay client </li>
  <li>a splash screen</li>
  <li>an about box</li>
  <li>a helpfile viewer</li>
  <li>a javadoc viewer</li>
  <li>report generation and viewing</li>
  <li>a stock ticker / weather reporter<br>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>What XHTML/CSS features does Flying Saucer currently support?</h2>
<p>  With our third release on August 31st it supports most of
  the common XHTML and CSS features. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    text and images (paragraphs, bold, italics, fonts, alignment, etc)</li>
  <li> the box model (borders, backgrounds, padding, margins)</li>
  <li>forms</li>
  <li>tables</li>
  <li>list items</li>
  <li>most CSS properties and shorthands</li>
  <li>some float and absolute positioning support</li>
</ul>
<h2>What XHTML/CSS features is Flying Saucer missing?</h2>
<p> The main things that are missing as of R3 is the automatic table model (the
  old Netscape style of tables where the size of the content determined the size
  of the cells.) Fixed layout tables are supported. Floats and positioning (absolute,
  relative, fixed) are there but buggy. There is also no support for things outside
  the scope of XHTML/CSS such as Javascript, printing, Flash, SVG, or legacy
HTML (though there is interest in all of those).</p>
<h2>How do I make my program follow
hyperlinks?</h2>
<p>You'll need to create a mouse listener that detects link clicks
    and does the HTTP request. See <a href="gettingstarted.html#hyperlinks">Creating a HyperLink Listener</a> in
    the <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting
Started Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I get access to the Swing components that make up
my form fields?</h2>
<p> You can use the form accessor methods on the context. See <a href="gettingstarted.html#formaccess">Form
    Field Access</a>  in the <a href="gettingstarted.html#hyperlinks">Getting Started Guide</a>.<br>
