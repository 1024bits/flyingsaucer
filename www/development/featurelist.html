<h1>Flying Saucer Supported Features</h1>


<p>Flying Saucer supports the bulk of the strict XHTML and CSS 2.1 standards. We are working
towards complete (and correct) feature support of these standards, but not everything
works yet.  Most of it is there, though.</p>

<h3>General XHTML / CSS features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>General formatted text: basically everything: paragraphs and spans, bold, italic, font sizes, text alignment, horizontal alignment,
	different fonts</li>
	<li>The full box model: border, padding, margin, colors, background images, styled borders</li>
	<li>Full positioning support: static, relative, absolute, and fixed, and floats. <i>There are still some
	issues dealing with multiple stacked floats. This code is being rewritten.</i></li>
	<li>Tables: Table support is currently being rewritten so check on the mailing list to see what works.</li>
	<li>Forms: Every standard form control is represented. There are still some bugs with alignment.</li>
	<li>Images: both as inline images with the &lt;img&gt; tag and with background images.
	<li>:hover styles for rollover effects</li>
	<li>Lists: lists with proper positioning and
	<li>CSS selectors. All CSS selectors in the spec should be supported, even the sibling/child ones</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Speed. We are fast enough to render all of Hamlet in under 4 seconds on a 1.5 GHZ Pentium. We are working
	to improve speed and memory usage all the time.</li>
	<li>Embedded fonts. You can embed a truetype font in your application (in the jar file), and use it in pages
	rendered in your application.</li>
	<li>Printing. You can print anything you can see on screen. You can even use special print stylesheets. <b><i>pagination
	is not currently supported!</i></b></li>
	
</ul>
