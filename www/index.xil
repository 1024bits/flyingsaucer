This project website and our User's Guide are produced using the "Xilize":http://xilize.sourceforge.net/ (http://xilize.sourceforge.net/) syntax and rendering engine. The content is written in Xilize text markup, then converted to XHTML using the Xilize converter. We'd like to thank the Xilize team at CenteredWork for sharing this library. Try it out! It's a great way to write websites quickly, without losing control over formatting. Check it out!

<img src="/images/made-with-jedit-9.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

Editing took place using the legendary "jEdit editor":http://www.jedit.org/ (http://www.jedit.org/) editor. Xilize produces a plugin for jEdit, where you get syntax highlighting for the Xilize markup, quick markup controls, and a XIL converter all built-in to the editor.

"JetBrains":http://www.jetbrains.com, the makers of "IntelliJ IDEA":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea, has generously sponsored a license letting us use IDEA on this project under their Open Source Program. We are grateful for their support!
