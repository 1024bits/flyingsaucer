 *
 * Revision 1.43  2004/12/12 04:18:56  tobega

 * Still broken, won't even compile at the moment. Working hard to fix it, though. Replace the StyleReference interface with our only concrete implementation, it was a bother changing in two places all the time.
 *
 * Revision 1.37  2004/12/10 06:51:02  tobega
 * Shamefully, I must now check in painfully broken code. Good news is that Layout is much nicer, and we also handle :before and :after, and do :first-line better than before. Table stuff must be brought into line, but most needed is to fix Render. IMO Render should work with Boxes and Content. If Render goes for a node, that is wrong.
